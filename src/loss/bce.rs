//! # Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss
//!
//! Calculates the binary cross-entropy loss between predicted and target values.
//! NOTE: This loss function requires both predicted and target probabilities.
//! The current library structure for loss calculation only provides the error term
//! (e.g., predicted - target) to the individual loss functions. Implementing BCE
//! correctly requires access to both the predicted value (y_pred) and the true target value (y_true).
//! This would require a change to the core loss API, for example, changing the `calculate`
//! function signature to accept both values.
//!
//! The formula for BCE is: -[y_true * log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * log(1 - y_pred)]
//!
//! This file serves as a placeholder to acknowledge the loss function.
//! A full implementation would require modifying the `get_loss` function in `mod.rs`
//! to pass both predicted and target values down to the individual loss calculators.

use super::Float;

// A potential signature for BCE if the API were changed:
// pub(super) fn calculate<T: Float>(predicted: &T, target: &T) -> T {
//     // Implementation would go here, requiring log functions from the Float trait.
//     // This is complex and requires the API change mentioned above.
//     // For example: -(*target * predicted.ln() + (T::ONE - *target) * (T::ONE - *predicted).ln())
//     // The `ln` (natural log) function would need to be added to the `Float` trait.
//     todo!("BCE requires API change to pass both predicted and target values.")
// }

/// Placeholder function that cannot correctly implement BCE with the current API.
pub fn calculate<T: Float>(_value: &T) -> T {
    // This is not a real BCE calculation.
    // It simply returns zero to satisfy the compiler and indicate the limitation.
